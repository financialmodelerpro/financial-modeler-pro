| CMS management | ✅ Complete | Content editing |
| Page builder | ✅ Complete | Page list + section editor with drag-and-drop |
| Articles CRUD | ✅ Complete | List + new + edit pages |

| Testimonials (all/training/modeling) | ✅ Complete | Hub-specific filtering |
| Branding | ✅ Merged into Header Settings (2026-04-28, commit `ab5db30`) | Brand Colors section now lives at the top of `/admin/header-settings`. `/admin/branding` is a 5-line server redirect to the new home so existing bookmarks keep working. Same `/api/branding` GET + PATCH endpoints, same `branding_config` table, same `BrandingThemeApplier` consumer — only the editing surface relocated. Sidebar entry removed; Header Settings gains `matchPaths: ['/admin/branding']`. |
| Pricing | ✅ Single Platform Pricing surface | `/admin/pricing` rewritten 2026-04-28 (commits `50e22fa` + `777e1bf`) — no tab bar. Plans tab + Page Content tab + Pricing Features tab + Module Access tab all removed across 2026-04-27 / 2026-04-28. Migration 145 dropped `pricing_plans` (commit `777e1bf`). Hero text + FAQ for the public `/pricing` page are now edited in **Page Builder → Pricing** (slug='pricing'); the public page reads `page_sections` directly. Plan-based feature gating ripped out in commit `d8405e5`; REFM premium features lock to `false` until paid tiers go live. |
| Audit log | ✅ Complete | `AuditLogViewer` component |
| System health | ✅ Complete | `SystemHealth` component |
| Media management | ✅ Complete | Upload and manage assets |
| Modules config | ✅ Complete | Module configuration panel |

| AI agents | 🟡 Partial | Market rates + research wired; contextual help is stub only |
| Design system (CSS tokens) | ✅ Complete | `globals.css` — do not modify |

## 2. Known Bugs & Issues

### P1 — Functional (needs testing/fixing)

| Bug | Location | Details |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Join button needs e2e testing | `app/training/live-sessions/[id]/page.tsx` | Logic fixed in `0d95efd` — join link appears 30 min before for registered students. Needs manual test with real upcoming session + registration data. |
| Certificate badges may show generic icons | Dashboard achievements section | Badge images may show generic fallback instead of actual PNG from Supabase `badges` bucket. Verify `badge_url` is populated in `student_certificates` table. Download API: `GET /api/training/badges/download?certId=` |
| Pricing enforcement not implemented | REFM | Plan-based feature gating system was removed 2026-04-27 (commit `d8405e5`). REFM `canAccess()` stubs to `false`, locking premium features pre-launch. Pricing tables `pricing_features` + `pricing_modules` were dropped in migration 144; the generic `pricing_plans` catalog was dropped in migration 145 (2026-04-28). When paid tiers launch, gating returns as a focused new feature spec — server-enforced from day one, built on the surviving `platform_pricing` + `platform_features` + `plan_feature_access` tables. |

### P2 — Visual consistency

| Bug | Location | Details |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Public page cards don't match dashboard | `app/training-sessions/SessionsClient.tsx` | Cards are inline-styled divs. Dashboard uses `SessionCard.tsx`. No shared component exists. |
| Dashboard preview vs full listing mismatch | `UpcomingSessionsPreview.tsx` vs `live-sessions/page.tsx` | Two different card designs for the same sessions. |

### P3 — Minor / cosmetic

| Bug | Location | Details |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Instructor title fallback text | `app/training-sessions/[id]/DetailClient.tsx:268` | Falls back to "Financial Modeling Expert" when title is empty. May not be desired for all instructors. Null guards are in place (`&&` and `||`). |

### Not bugs — verified working
- Instructor title null checks: properly guarded with `&&` / `||` across all surfaces
- Profile photo crop: react-easy-crop integrated, square aspect, zoom slider
- Points/streak: loads from activity API, displays in dashboard
- No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments found in codebase

- **Apps Script URL**: Also stored in Supabase `training_settings` table as fallback, editable at `/admin/training-settings`

---

## 6. Deployment Process

### Standard deployment
```bash
# 1. Verify locally
npm run verify          # runs: type-check + lint + build

# 2. Push to main (auto-deploys to Vercel)
git push origin main

# 3. Verify health
curl https://financialmodelerpro.com/api/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok", "platform": "financial-modeler-pro", "version": "3.0" }
```

### Individual checks
```bash
npm run type-check      # tsc --noEmit — must be zero errors
npm run build           # next build --webpack (avoids MAX_PATH on Windows/OneDrive)
```

### How to update Apps Script URL
1. **Via admin panel**: Go to `https://financialmodelerpro.com/admin/training-settings` -> update the Apps Script URL field -> Save
2. **Via env var**: Update `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` in Vercel Environment Variables dashboard -> redeploy
3. **Priority**: Env var is checked first; Supabase `training_settings` table is fallback
4. **Code location**: `src/lib/training/sheets.ts` handles the resolution

### How to run database migrations
1. Migrations are in `supabase/migrations/` (numbered 002-041)
2. **Never edit existing migrations** — create new ones with next number (042+)
3. Run via Supabase dashboard SQL editor or `supabase db push`
4. Update `CLAUDE-DB.md` after running

### Cron jobs
| Job | Schedule | Endpoint | Auth |
|-----|----------|----------|------|
| Certificate generation | Every 15 minutes | `GET /api/cron/certificates` | `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` |

Configured in `vercel.json`. Calls `processPendingCertificates()` with 5-minute timeout.

## 7. What Was Last Being Worked On

The last session (2026-04-28) was a **follow-up admin cleanup** continuing the trim work from 2026-04-27. Three further surfaces consolidated:

### Changes made (commits `ab5db30` → `777e1bf`)
- **Part A** (`ab5db30`): Branding merged into Header Settings. After 2026-04-27's Phase 4 reduced `/admin/branding` to two color fields, the dedicated page was a thin wrapper. Brand Colors section moved to the top of `/admin/header-settings`, wired to the same `/api/branding` GET + PATCH endpoints. `saveAll()` now fires the cms_content writes plus `/api/branding` PATCH in parallel. `/admin/branding/page.tsx` reduced to a 5-line server `redirect('/admin/header-settings')`. Sidebar Branding entry removed; Header Settings gains `matchPaths: ['/admin/branding']` so the rail stays highlighted on stale links. `BrandingThemeApplier` + `branding_config` table + `--color-primary` / `--color-secondary` injection all unchanged. Net -349 / +102.
- **Part B-2** (`50e22fa`): Pricing Page Content tab removed. Diagnosis surfaced a real bug: the tab wrote to `cms_content` (section='pricing_page') but Page Builder writes to `page_sections` (slug='pricing'); the public `/pricing` page only read from `cms_content`, so Page Builder edits for the pricing slug were dead writes. Migration 046 had already seeded `page_sections` correctly, so `/pricing` was repointed to `getAllPageSections('pricing')` — hero badge / title / subtitle from `pricing.hero` content, FAQ items from `pricing.faq` content's `items[]` (with per-item `visible !== false` filter). Tab type narrowed to `'plans' \| 'platform'`. Net -84 / +35.
- **Part B-1** (`777e1bf`): Plans tab removed + migration 145. The generic Free/Starter/Professional/Enterprise plan catalog (`pricing_plans`, migs 014/018) was the original pricing model but never wired into payment or feature gating — `platform_pricing` + `platform_features` + `plan_feature_access` (migs 076/077) is the canonical per-platform model that drives the public pricing page. Home-page pricing-teaser plan-name pill row removed (only public consumer); replaced with a clean "View Full Pricing →" CTA-only block. With Plans gone + Page Content gone, only Platform Pricing remained — `/admin/pricing/page.tsx` rewritten with no tab bar at all. Files deleted: `app/api/admin/pricing/plans/route.ts`, the local `getPublicPlanNames()` helper in home page, the orphan `getPublicPlanNames()` export in `src/lib/shared/cms.ts`. `Plan` / `UserOption` / `FormState` types + `BLANK_FORM` + `PlanCard` sub-component + plan handlers + user-search effect all gone. Migration 145: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pricing_plans CASCADE`. Net -598 / +156.

**Net total**: ~-1031 lines across 3 commits, 7 files modified, 1 file deleted, 1 migration created.

### Manual action required
- **Apply migration 145 via Supabase dashboard SQL editor before next deploy.** Migration 144 from the 2026-04-27 session has already been run. Migration 145 is idempotent (`IF EXISTS` + `CASCADE`) so re-runs are safe.

### Unfinished from that session
None — all 3 commits shipped to `origin/main`. Type-check + full build passed at every step. Both migrations 144 and 145 confirmed applied in Supabase.

---

## 8. Next Steps (prioritized)

### Immediate (polish from last session)
1. Create universal session card component at `src/components/sessions/SessionCard.tsx`
2. Test join button flow end-to-end with a real upcoming session
3. Verify badge images display correctly (check `badge_url` population)

### Short-term
4. Reintroduce pricing/subscription enforcement as a focused new feature spec when paid tiers go live (the previous system was removed 2026-04-27 in commit `d8405e5` — admin-only with no server-side gating). Server-enforced from day one, smaller surface than the deleted system.
5. Complete AI contextual help agent (stub exists)

### Medium-term
7. REFM Module 2: Revenue Analysis
8. REFM Module 3: Operating Expenses
9. REFM Module 4: Returns & Valuation
10. REFM Modules 7-9

### Long-term
11. 9 additional modeling platforms (BVM, FPA, ERM, PFM, LBO, CFM, EUM, SVM, BCM)
